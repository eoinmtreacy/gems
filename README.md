# Gemvironmentally Friendly
A group project for a Java programming module.
## Contributions
- A* Pathfinding implementation for guided transport (i.e. buses and trams)
- External (not moving through obstacles) and internal (not leaving valid roads) collision detection
- UI design and scoring implementation
## Design and Goals
_Gemvironmentally Friendly_ is designed to encourage the use of sustainable transport options. Each level, the player is tasked with collectin a number gems scattered throughout the map within the time-limit.
The player _can_ just jump in a car and zoom around the map, but their _Footprint_ will increase dramatically. Their score for completely the level is penalised accordingly. 
However, if the takes the time to plan their journey, using the minimap and shared transport options, they will still be able to collect the gems within the time limit and their score will be much higher.
