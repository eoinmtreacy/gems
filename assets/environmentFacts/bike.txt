You have got on a bike! This is a great way to travel around as there is low carbon cost to use it.
Bikes Don't Pollute: When you ride a bike, you don't create any smoke or pollution. It’s like magic—moving forward without dirtying the air!
Quiet as a Mouse: Bikes are super quiet compared to cars and buses. This means less noise in our towns and cities.
No Fuel Needed: Bikes work on pedal power, not fuel like gasoline, which means you’re helping save the Earth's precious resources every time you ride.
Easy on the Roads: Since bikes are so light, they don’t crack the roads like heavy cars and trucks do. This means roads last longer and need less fixing!
More Trees, Please: Fewer cars mean we can have more space for parks and trees instead of big roads and parking lots.
Stay Healthy: Riding your bike is not only fun but also great for your health, which means less illness and more playtime!
Save the Animals: Less pollution and quieter streets from biking can make our cities friendlier places for birds and animals.
Less Oil Used: Cars need oil to go, but bikes just need your energy. By biking, we use less oil, which helps protect the Earth.
Super Efficient: Did you know? Biking uses less energy than any other way of getting around, so it’s super smart!
Save Water: Cars need lots of water to be made and to run, but bikes need very little, which helps save water for fishes and farms.
Fewer Traffic Jams: Bikes take up less space than cars, so if more people ride bikes, there will be less traffic and everyone gets where they’re going faster.
Bikes Last a Long Time: Bikes can be used for many years and passed down to younger brothers or sisters, making them a super choice for families.
Recyclable: Bikes are mostly made of metal, which means they can be recycled when they're too old to use, turning them into new things instead of trash.
Animals love you: Gavin the turtle loves when you ride your bike!
Friendly Streets: Streets with lots of bikers are safer and friendlier—more chances to say hi to your neighbors!
Be a Leader: By choosing to bike, you can inspire others to do the same, creating a happier and healthier community.
Adventure Time: Biking is a fun way to explore. You can see, hear, and smell things you’d miss in a car.
Creatures Big and Small: Fewer cars mean safer roads for creatures like squirrels and birds, keeping our animal friends happy and healthy.
Happy Earth: Every time you ride a bike instead of asking for a car ride, you’re giving a little gift to the Earth.
Fun and Free: Biking is a fun way to get to places like school or the park, and it’s free—you don’t need to spend money on gas or bus tickets.
