You've got in a car. You're some knacker. Animals are crying, Gavin the turtle is sad.
Cars Use Lots of Fuel: Cars need gasoline or diesel to go, and using this fuel creates air pollution, which is not good for our planet.
Noise Makers: Cars can be noisy, especially in busy cities. This noise can disturb people and animals too.
They Need Space: Cars take up a lot of space for driving and parking. This means less room for parks, playgrounds, and other fun places.
Pollution Creators: Cars produce exhaust fumes that can make the air dirty and unhealthy to breathe.
Lots of Cleaning: Manufacturing and using cars requires lots of water. This water could be used for drinking or watering plants instead.
Traffic Jams: Where there are lots of cars, there are often traffic jams, which means everyone gets slowed down.
Road Wear: Cars are heavy and can wear out roads quickly, which means roads need to be repaired often.
Uses Lots of Resources: Cars are made from metal, plastic, and glass, which requires a lot of Earth's resources to make.
Not So Efficient: Compared to bikes or walking, cars use a lot more energy to move around, which isn't as good for the environment.
Health Effects: The fumes from cars can make the air unhealthy, which might make it harder to breathe, especially for kids and old people.
Danger to Animals: Cars can be dangerous for animals that try to cross the road. We need to be very careful to keep them safe.
They Get Hot: Cars, especially their engines, can get very hot and contribute to heating up our cities.
Big Carbon Footprint: Cars add a lot of carbon dioxide to the air, a gas that contributes to global warming.
Need Oil: Cars depend a lot on oil, which is a natural resource that we have to be careful not to use up too quickly.
Changes to the Earth: To make room for cars, we sometimes have to change the land, which can hurt the plants and animals living there.
Not Recyclable: While some parts of a car can be recycled, a lot of it ends up as waste, which isn't good for the Earth.
Water Pollution: Cars can leak oil and other chemicals that can pollute waterways, harming fish and other water creatures.
Limited Lifespan: Cars usually last for a few years before they need to be replaced, which means we keep needing more resources to make new ones.
Everyone's Responsibility: Driving a car is a big responsibility because it affects everyone's environment, so it's important to think about how often we use them.
Energy Hungry: To make and run cars, we use a lot of energy, which can come from sources that aren't always good for the Earth.
